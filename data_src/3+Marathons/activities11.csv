Came through the 15k & 10 mile 6 seconds ahead of half PR so was really hoping this would be the case.  Last mile with 7? Turns and potholes and my watch went from being .03-.04 off which is great to .11 behind at the 20k.  Maybe I added some with all the turns but I doubt it, just couldn’t cover the additional unaccounted for distance in a last .7.  60 degrees at the start 90% humidity wasn’t ideal but managed it well considering.  At least my last 0.2 was solid 🤷🏻‍♀️

I do think gps lost satellite at a few spots so maybe?  Mile 2 got funky pace wise on my watch and came up short at the mile marker.  I hit the lap button and was then spot on the next 2 miles, so maybe somewhere in there.  Would be interested in knowing when others got off.  Also wide roads so where you ran could easily make it short or long.
Regardless was under 23:00 at 4 miles on my watch before messing it up which is a PR.  24 second 10k pr if accurate, otherwise at least right at PR time

Super frustrating.  Was having a great workout then gps got funky as it started to rain.  The “square” is a kilometer, always has been.  around the 5th lap it was no longer beeping when i came across the spot I started, I kept running until it beeped on one then hit lap on 2 but it really threw me for a loop.  def started out hot but i swear i think i was holding it within reason second half.
90 sec rests between laps, walking so i didn’t start at the “segment” every time.  
4 x fast pickups at the end with 30 sec rest bc i was so annoyed.
