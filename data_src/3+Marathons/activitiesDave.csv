Such a great time, who knew you could get 5 willing participants for something like this. We ended up in light rain for a lot of the night (started at 7 PM and ran through the night), with a few heavy downpours. Luckily Clint spotted a huge fallen tree big enough for all 5 of us to hunker down under during the worst of it. That was 2:04 AM. Ended up making it to Mud Lake Lean-to at daybreak. Took a short rest before the return trip. We were blessed with a huge snapping turtle with a very shiny polished looking shell. Thought it was dead but it was very much alive. Near Woods Lake, Clint spotted two very small bear cubs. They climbed a huge tree, it was awesome. Joe and I lingered back for a few minutes and got to see the mother. She walked out and gave us a stern stare as if to say ""get the eff out of here"". We did. The last 10 miles seemed like it took forever. I think we all had sore feet from being wet for over 20 hours. All in all, a very successful and fun trip!

5933674883,"Sep 9, 2021, 1:18:19 PM",Scary Bear Encounter Mile 14- Myka and Tyson saved the day??,Run,"Great trail run with the Cattle Dogs, a lot of lakes- Ayers, Long, Third, Good Luck, Dry, Dexter lakes and Waters Millpond.  Even took a boat ride on Third Lake. There was a boat and makeshift paddle made of a branch and some duct tape. Myka was annoying trying to bite the paddle each time I switched sides. 
All was well until mile 14. Got to Good Luck trail register and turned toward Dry Lake.  Came over a little hill and saw 4 bears on/around the trail in a group, very close to us. They saw us and scattered, Three of them went to the right- the dogs followed those three. The 4th went to the left by itself... I was a little uncomfortable but have never been scared of any animal in the woods... well, that changed today. I called Myka and Tyson several times, I couldn't see or hear them. After calling them a few times, the bear that went to the left came back in a hurry. The bear jumped up on a large fallen tree trunk and stood up and stared at me. I didn't know what to do other than make myself look big. It was close enough that I could see its eyes. I put my arms out to look big and we just stared at each other. It seemed like we were staring at each other for a very long time (probably 20-30 seconds but it seemed like minutes!)... I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to yell to the dogs again and for sure didn't want to run, so I just stood there with my arms out staring, trying not to move. Luckily the dogs came running back. When they saw the bear, they went over to it but didn't bark or growl which I thought they would. Luckily they got close and the bear backed down, jumped off the log and ran a short distance. The dogs followed it, I was calling the dogs back, all the while looking behind me nervous that the other 3 bears were still around somewhere. The dogs started coming back and the bear turned at them, charged a short distance and made an odd hissing noise. Finally it turned away and kept going the other way and the dogs and I started going down the trail. It really freaked me out but I was glad the dogs were there. I've seen bears quite a few times in the woods, but never have I been nervous at all. Today I was scared shitless for a bit.  Really sorry for the long read but I don't know how to shorten it up (for anyone that actually read the whole thing). 
Oh and the thing that really struck me about the whole encounter was how quiet things were. I thought the dogs would be barking and growling. The only noise the whole time was me yelling at the dogs to come back and the hissing noise the bear made.

Many good training runs and races. A few special memories are: 56@56 Birthday Run, Fire Tower Challenge, Escarpment, Idiot Run and many good races. Boston and Rehoboth Beach marathons. 
Boston has a special place in my heart after breaking the neck of my femur less than a mile from the finish line on my first attempt in 2005. This year was especially emotional for me to place in my age group. I never thought in my wildest dreams that would be possible for me. Thanks to all for the miles we've run together!!

Got it cleaned off and fired up.

I had one oat bar for fuel, but unfortunately I lost it out of my pocket. I did an out/back so I searched for it on the way back, but never did find it.

8312182157,"Dec 30, 2022, 2:59:35 PM",Dog Walking - Tyson's 3rd Birthday ,Hike,"Tyson's journey began in Kentucky, where he was surrendered to a high kill shelter. We don't know anything more than that about his first 11 months of life. He (luckily) was transported to the Herkimer Humane Society, which is where we found him and fell in love with him. Myka needed a playmate! He definitely had (and still has) some baggage, but he's come a long way since we adopted him as a family member. If you are bored and wish to continue reading, the following poem fits Tyson 100 percent!

Now that I'm home, bathed, settled and fed,
All nicely tucked in my warm new bed,
I'd like to open my baggage,
Lest I forget,
There is so much to carry,
So much to regret.

Hmmm...Yes, there it is, right on the top,

Let's unpack Loneliness, Heartache and Loss,
And there by my leash hides Fear and Shame.

As I look on these things I tried so hard to leave,
I still have to unpack my baggage called Pain.

I loved them, the others, the ones who left me,
But I wasn't good enough - for they didn't want me.

Will you add to my baggage?
Will you help me unpack?

Or will you just look at my things,
And take me right back?
Do you have the time to help me unpack?

To put away my baggage, to never repack?
I pray that you do - I'm so tired you see,
But I do come with baggage,
Will you still want me?

I was able to hit 100 miles, got my 4 20's in, and a HUGE shout-out to all my friends at the Utica Roadrunners. I am honored to have been inducted into the URR Hall of Fame last night. I am at a loss for words. I cherish this time of my life, and the countless hours I spend with my running friends. I don't take it for granted, every run is a gift. 
Also, the last song (for all of you 70's and 80's rockers) that came on while I was finishing this run was ""Boston"" Piece of Mind. Awesome!

9240635297,"Jun 10, 2023, 1:38:33 PM",20 on the Beach 🏖️- Little Kids have The-Perfect-Running-Form! ,Run,"Ran on the beach, pretty good surface. Beach got pretty crowded by the end and the tide was coming in making it harder to find a good path. After almost 3 hours of observation, I'd say children 3-10 years old running on the beach with bare feet have got absolutely perfect running form. Without exception, every kid I saw running had perfect form. I guess we develop bad habits as we age.

Going through St. Johnsville I saw an elderly lady sitting on the curb with her door open and her cane and pocketbook next to her. She didn't look like she was in distress, so I went past her. Then I thought, well, that's an odd place to sit. 
I went back and asked her if she needed anything. She said ""yes, could you please help me up, then I'll be okay"". I helped her up. She had opened the door, backed up and caught her heel on the curb and fell backwards. 
I asked her if she was okay, were her hips okay. She replied ""Well, luckily I have a big dupa!"".
 I only know what a dupa is because I have some polish friends that translated for me years ago. LoL.

There was a ton of blowdown and mud, making the going very slow, especially during the night. We saw moose tracks early on, and one deer stood by the trail when we went by it during the night. It really was a blast!!! Weather was good, just a little bit of rain in the morning. Our feet are all pretty shot I think, hopefully they'll be better in a few days. 
I can't thank Tom and Joe enough for putting this together, all I have to do is show up!

Today I went by a pair of them with 4 little ones, there was a fence on the left side and that's the side the geese were on. I slowed to a walk and went right as far as I could. One of them (as expected) turned and hissed. I walked slowly past but it followed me for a bit, then went airborne and whacked me in the back of the head a few times with it's wings! Woke me up, they weren't there when I went back through. I think maybe they felt trapped with the fence there so they were a little more aggressive. I also saw two snapping turtles, one of them was laying eggs right next to the path. They were sweethearts, unlike the geese!!
