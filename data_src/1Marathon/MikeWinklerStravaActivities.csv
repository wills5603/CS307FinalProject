3 easy > 3 up > bout 2.5 down


Warm was huffin a bit, nothing I couldn't keep down with keeping the heartrate low as recommended. 


3 up felt great. A little too up on the first one pace wise, so feel like I should keep the heart rate lower as I begin this (maybe look at pace and go for 8:10-8:20 as I begin these?). Middle one felt great, last one was tough with tiny bit of climb. Again, felt like I started the 3 up too hot pace wise. 


Cool down was perfect!

Felt great coming off Boilermaker and more effort miles this past week! Plus a 19 hour day yesterday up late with the band and on 6 hours sleep 😂 Right amount of effort, maybe could have gone stronger on the start or at the finish. Had to hold myself up on the dude at the finish who was taking tags off for timing, and felt I could have gone a bit deeper into a harder pace, so there's room for improvement. Feel like 4 x mile repeats at 6:40/:50 with 3 minute recovery could be a good way to get that upper limit tested. 

Feeling confident going into Tunnel to Towers and Run 4 River Half 😀

11993349941,"Jul 27, 2024, 10:48:21 AM",Day 9 NYC Marathon training with Chris for a bit,Run,"Chris went long and did some of his steady state at the track while I zipped around. He was looking strong and it was cool to cross paths every so often. I've done this a few times and it's kinda fun to do different stuff at the track while others are doing their thing.

This was 5 x 6 minutes at around 6:50/mile with about 1:30 walking recovery then set the chi form and jog into the start of the next rep to bring total rest to 2 minutes. Cool down was excellent, just falling forward and super easy.

Felt very strong and as if the pace was right where it should be as I was going for about 8k pace. Maybe could have pushed a little more on the pace, but wanted to feel comfortably strong. I might want to try this workout again, but combine the 3rd and 4th rep into a 12 minute stretch with a 3 or 4 minute recovery. Thoughts?

I think on this trajectory I should be sub 20 for the T2T 5k and the Run 4 River half marathon should be around a 1:32ish. 

Gonna go long tomorrow, possibly 20. Thinking 12 VERY EASY 9 to 10 minutes pace. Then 6 at endurance 8 to 9 minutes pace steady or progression, and see how I'm feeling for the last 2 miles.

Everything up to that felt great, and thinking back on it right now as I'm walking back home I went way too fast down Roberts Road. I should have been about a minute to a minute and a half slower closer to 9:30 or 10 minute Pace and then on the flats coming off of Holman City same thing. Should have been 9:30. Just should have kept it easy. And then enter the endurance zone once I maybe settled into the flatter part of Oxford, maybe by Kellogg Road or by New Hartford high School. So it was a learning experience and I think coming off of all those endurance miles last week I can't beat myself up over this. I'm at 50 something miles for the week so that's awesome. Rest tomorrow!!!!

Just kept my heart rate under 125 for a while and the last 2 miles felt awesome. 5 strides at the end felt great. Granted there was way less humidity and I had vaporflys on (whatever I felt awesome and needed the confidence boosy 😂), I felt so much more in control because I went very easy for about the first 80% of that run.


I kind of want to do the same thing tomorrow. Just maybe amp up the last 2 miles a little more I don't know. We'll see. I think holding my heart rate steady at 130 to 140 in this type of temperature and humidity could be very beneficial and then steady 140 to 145 for the last miles.

 Thinking back to Saturday, I would say my heart rate should have been no higher than 130 and then get it up to 135-140 and hold steady. I was approaching 150 and even over 150 too soon and that just cooked me.

Kept it super in check up to mile 20 then ramped the HR up. Fueled every 4 miles (set up a little water station at the foot of my driveway 🤣) 2 Maurten 160s, 2 Maurten 100s, and 2 Glukos lemon lime with caffeine. Stayed down super easy, so happy! Had the Maurtens safety pinned inside the waist band of my tights, and the 2 Glukos in the side pocket. Worked perfectly. Finished with lunge matrix 5 reps, these help a TON. No more lower back pain or tightness since I was introduced to them by Coach Karen 💪🙏

Overall very happy with the first race based on heart rate even though I botched up the targets! Got way too high too soon. Especially with the back half of this course being a steady climb. Still 100% confident in the HR training, I need to remember to keep my heart rate lower than I think it should be at the beginning of all races from here on out. Also, the most refreshed I've felt a couple hours after a race.

Loosely quoting Clayton Young, quoting Kipchoge, ""it's good to run some the week after the marathon and see if there's anything lingering that needs attention. Then rest more in the following weeks."" Everything feels loose and fresh so far and I'm going to keep my HR 120 to 135.

I'm tempted to go longer tomorrow, very low HR. 20 probably isn't the best idea, but if the effort is minimal, why not? I think at least 10, and we'll see what happens at that point.
